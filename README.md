## Installation

Simply clone the repo, and replace your own config files with the config files that you've just downloaded, of course depending on which programs/configurations you want to use. 

Note: 
- I am using `pywal16` to generate a color palette based on my wallpaper, which gets utilized in most of the programs to match the theme.
- Be sure to check for any hardcoded full file paths (e.g. `/home/myuser/Desktop/whatever` as opposed to `~/Desktop/whatever`).
- Be aware of different keybinds, specifically within `.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`.
